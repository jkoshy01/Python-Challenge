# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Objective:

Congrats you've made it!

You have just completed the Excel sheet and join the big data leagues. As we the start the journey of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, we will be using the concepts that you've learned to complete these two Python Challenges , The PyBank and The PyPoll.

Before You Start

* First you will create a new repository for this project and name it "Python - Challenge". "Please do not add this homework to any existing repository".

* Then you will clone the new repository to your computer.

* Then in your local git repository, you will create a directory for both of challenges. You will create a folder named  "PyBank" and "PyPoll".

* Here are the following items you will need inside your folder:

  * Create a file and name it 'main.py'. This will be the script that will run your data
  * In your "Resource" folder  will contain the CSV files that you have use in this assignment and to make sure your script runs the correct csv path.
  * In the "analysis" folder you will create a text file that will show your final result of your analysis

 
 
 PyBank Challenge 

* First step, in this challenge, the task is to create a Python script that will analyze the financial records based on your company. 
  You will use this file [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) to create the data set. 

* Next you will create a Python script that will record and calculate the following:

* Calculate the "Total number of months

* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the  period

* Average of the in "Profit/Losses" over the period

* The greatest increase in profits over the period

* The greatest decrease in losses over the period."

* Here is an example below:
  
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  

PyPoll Challenge:

* In this assignment, you are helping a small town to help count the voting process

*You will use this resource to composed your data set. Pull this resource thisPyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv. 

*Here are the steps to calculate the analysis:
 
 * " Calculate the total number of votes

 * The percentage of the candidates that had won

 * The number of votes the candidate had won

 * And the winner of the election based on popular vote."

Here is how the analysis should look like
