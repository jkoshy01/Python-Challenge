Objective:

You have just completed the Excel sheet and join the big data leagues, as we the start the journey of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, we will be using the skills that you've learned to complete these two Python Challenges , The PyBank and The PyPoll.



Before You Start: Here are the steps to follow

* First you will create a new repository for this project and name it "Python - Challenge". "Please do not add this homework to any existing repository".

* Then you will clone the new repository from your computer to Github

* Then in your repository, You will create a folder named  "PyBank" and "PyPoll". 

* Here are the following items you will need inside your folder:
